*** Dump default linker script
ld --verbose

*** Dump memory contents of a binary (generate a core file)
gcore -a -o dump.bin <pid>

The core file contents are mapped to section addresses that can be obtained using the following command:
readelf -Wl dump.bin

*** Get pid of program
print (int)getpid()

*** Watch function return values until it equals something
# This requires the program to be running before it is usable, so set a breakpoint in main
# and run to it first

# On x86-64, $rax stores the return value of function calls
# This watch will return a number we will use cond on
watch $rax

cond <breakpoint_number_returned_by_watch> $rax == <value_here>
