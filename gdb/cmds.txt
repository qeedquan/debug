*** Generate coredump

The process must be running.

gcore [file]

To load the core when debugging:
gdb <binary> <coredump>

*** Dump memory to file
dump binary memory result.bin <start_address> <end_address>

*** Load memory from file into process
restore filename [binary] bias start end

bias      - the address where the program will load the memory to
start/end - file offsets

*** Show memory

- hex
x/{number of bytes}b <addr>
	x/5b 0x1000

- string
# to print full string (default is truncation)
set print elements 0

x/s <addr>

- diassembly
x/{number of instructions}i <addr>
	x/5s 0x1000

*** Show assembly in a panel
layout asm

*** Print a pointer as a dynamic array with a length
p *variable@length

*** Show disassembly in different flavors
- As intel
set disassembly-flavor intel

- As ATT
set disassembly-flavor att

*** Dynamically add new data types to binaries
Define all the data structure in a source file and compile it with

cc -c -g3 -ggdb src.c

This will make a src.o that we can load with this command in gdb:
add-symbol-file src.o 0

Then all the types defined in the source file is available for use

*** Relocate symbol offsets
For binaries that have debugging information defined at an offset not the same as where the binary get loaded,
we can relocate the offset so gdb can map the addresses to the right symbol using the following:

# by default, gdb will load the symbol table from the binary on startup
# since we want to relocate it, we need to remove the old symbol file info
# do it with this command
symbol-file

# load symbol table from file and relocate it to offset
add-symbol-file <file> <offset>

*** Breakpoints

# Set breakpoints on all functions
rbreak .*

# Set breakpoint on functions matching regex
rbreak regex
rbreak ^func_name

# Delete breakpoint at a specific address
clear *0xdeadbeef

*** Watchpoints
rwatch does not work well, it misses some reads
awatch works better

# Disable hardware watchpoint (use software watchpoints)
# This is not always possible since some watch functions requires hardware breakpoints
set can-use-hw-watchpoints 0

*** Info

info sharedlibrary - List loaded shared libraries.
info signals - List all signals and how they are currently handled.
info threads - List all threads.
info args - Print the arguments to the function of the current stack frame.
info locals - Print the local variables in the currently selected stack frame.
